Methods Overriding in Java:

Methods overriding happends when we have same method in parent and child class classes.

Benefits:
1. Flexibility if we don't like something from parent class we can override
it and we can provide our owm implementation.
2.Same method can act differently depends ypon the object on witch we can call it.

Rules:
1. without inheritance method overriding is not possible
2. method signature should be same in parent class and in child class
3. if something does not participate in inheritance we can' override it like constructor

OOPS Main pillars:
1. Inheritance ( code re-usability)
2.Polymorphism ( less code dynamic code)
3.Abstraction (
4.Encapsulation
